      "Dissolve NaOH pellets in 20 mL de-ionised water and bring the solution to a gentle boil.",
      "With vigorous stirring add V2O5 portion-wise; maintain 100 °C until the orange solid fully dissolves, giving a clear yellow solution (≈ 30 min).",
      "Hot-filter the solution to remove any insoluble residue.",
      "Allow the filtrate to cool to ~60 °C, then add ~50 mL ice-cold ethanol while stirring; sodium metavanadate precipitates as fine colourless crystals.",
      "Collect the solid by vacuum filtration and wash twice with small portions of cold ethanol to remove residual NaOH.",
      "Dry the product at 80 °C for 2 h to obtain NaVO3·nH2O as an off-white powder."
